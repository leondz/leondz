### Hi there 👋


- 🔭 My research is on natural language processing and machine learning. I'm currently looking at:
  - 🛡️ **Online harms:** misinformation processing, hate speech & abusive language detection. [Work safely with this data!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14256)
  - 🌱 **Efficient machine learning:** we should be able to do more with much less than we have; always interested in data efficiency and greener, smaller, faster 🚀, coarser models
  - ✍️ **Generation:** Creating meaningful sequences from a set of items is hard! See our [JAIR paper on set2seq methods](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1613/jair.1.12839)
  - 🥼 **Clinical NLP:** how can we process medical records to, eventually, improve health outcomes
  - 🇩🇰 **NLP for Danish:** I started and run [the Danish Gigaword project](https://gigaword.dk)

- 🏢 I'm principal investigator of the [Strømberg NLP](https://stromberg.ai/) group at [ITU Copenhagen](https://en/itu.dk)

- 🧑‍🎓 I’m *still* learning [sizecoding](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Main_Page)

- 🎓 My papers are listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=d8iwqa8AAAAJ&hl=en). Ask me about any of them!
