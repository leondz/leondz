### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 My research is on natural language processing and machine learning. I'm currently looking at:
  - 🔒 **LLM security:** language model harms manifest if we don't treat them as unreliable and subvertible. [Follow @llm_sec](https://twitter.com/llm_sec)
  - 🛡️ **Online harms:** misinformation processing, hate speech & abusive language detection. [Work safely with this data!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14256)
  - 🌱 **Efficient machine learning:** we should be able to do more with much less than we have; always interested in data efficiency and greener, smaller, faster 🚀, coarser models. Read our [survey on efficient NLP in TACL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00099)!
  - ✍️ **Generation:** Creating meaningful sequences from a set of items is hard! See our [ICML paper on set2seq methods and the catalog problem](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xgFfr5IIuXP)
  - 🇩🇰 **NLP for Danish:** I started and run [the Danish Gigaword project](https://gigaword.dk)
<!--  - 🥼 **Clinical NLP:** how can we process medical records to, eventually, improve health outcomes -->

- 🏢 I'm principal investigator of the [Strømberg NLP](https://stromberg.ai/) group at [ITU Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk) & visiting professor at [UW NLP](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp) for my day job

- 🧑‍🎓 I’m *still* learning [sizecoding](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Main_Page)

- 🎓 My reearch papers are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=d8iwqa8AAAAJ&hl=en). Ask me about any of them!

- 🪶 I write NLP, machine learning, and language tech articles on my blog, [Inter Human Agreement](https://interhumanagreement.substack.com/)
